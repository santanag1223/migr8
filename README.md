# `migr8` - Community _driven_ ridesharing


## üìç Core Objectives

#### Respect drivers by putting drivers in-charge of their own pricing model.
- Drivers set their **rate ($/mile)**
  - 'Minimum-rates' should be set regionally to **ensure drivers are making a livable wage.**
    - Rate minimums should be subject to surge-pricing to match driver demand.
    - Present drivers with comparable ride rates to assist in setting their rate.
- Open new revenue streams for drivers by offering **additional comfort options for riders.**
  - Ride-Xtras (driver offers) such as stereo sharing, ad free music, baggage space, surplus-seating, additional-stops, truck bed, etc.
   
#### Respect riders by not selling any data to third parties, or ride-time to advertisers
- Advertisments are basically omnipresent today, and selling user data has become an industry norm.
- Since users don't appriecate either of these actions, `migr8` can stand out by promising to never sell user data or ride advertisments.
- By promising to treat users like people, and not just passing customers, `migr8` can foster a community built on trust and respect, and be the change **users** want to see.

#### Offer a better Rideshare App to drivers and riders alike with community-driven feautres.
- Preference-Matching: 
  - Preference Topics: Conversation, Music, Ride+Eat, Smoke+Vape, TalkMedia, etc.
  - A Preference is set to one of three values: (PreferNot | NoPreference | Prefer) for each topic
    - PreferNot: should **not** match with users who prefer topic.
    - NoPreference: the user is indifferent to topic.
    - Prefer: should match with users who prefer topic.
  - Present rider with their preference-match-summary for each prospective driver before they confirm a ride.
- Ride-Xtras (Driver Offers):
  - Standardized offering that driver's can choose to offer to riders after confirming a ride.
  - Some price variation allowed, but riders should feel they are getting a similar service for a similar price.

- Delivery Options: Request food or package delivery from local restaurants or stores.
