# `migr8` - Community _driven_ ridesharing

## 🚗 Mission Summary
`migr8` is a ridesharing platform built _by_ and _for_ drivers and riders — **not shareholders**. We reject the extractive gig-economy model by:
- Empowering drivers to set their own rates, earn livable wages, and monetize their unique offerings (_Ride-Xtras_).
- Respecting riders with transparent pricing, zero ads, and strict data privacy — no tracking, no selling, no headache.
- Fostering community through preference-based matching, local highlights, and collaborative feature development.

Our goal? A rideshare ecosystem where **fairness, trust, and human connection** drive innovation — not corporate profits.


## 📍 Core Objectives

#### 💰 Empower drivers by putting drivers in-charge of their own pricing model.
- Drivers set their **rate ($/mile)**
  - 'Minimum-rates' should be set regionally to **ensure drivers are making a livable wage.**
    - Rate minimums should be subject to surge-pricing to match driver demand.
    - Present drivers with comparable ride rates to assist in setting their rate.
- Open new revenue streams for drivers by offering **additional comfort options for riders.**
  - Ride-Xtras (driver offers) such as stereo sharing, ad free music, baggage space, surplus-seating, additional-stops, truck bed, etc.
- Help to amplify drivers' voices by assisting in forming regional driver unions, that can work with both `migr8` and local regulators, and ensure drivers' needs are being met.
   
#### 🔒 Respect riders by not selling any data to third parties, or ride-time to advertisers
- Advertisments are basically omnipresent today, and selling user data has become an industry norm.
- Since users don't appriecate either of these actions, `migr8` can stand out by promising to never sell user data or ride advertisments.
- By promising to treat users like people, and not just passing customers, `migr8` can foster a community built on trust and respect, and be the change **users** want to see.

#### 🙏 Offer a better Rideshare App to drivers and riders alike with community-driven feautres.
- Ride Preference-Matching: 
  - Preference Topics: Conversation, Music, Ride+Eat, Smoke+Vape, TalkMedia, etc.
  - A Preference is set to one of three values: (PreferNot | NoPreference | Prefer) for each topic
    - PreferNot: should **not** match with users who prefer topic.
    - NoPreference: the user is indifferent to topic.
    - Prefer: should match with users who prefer topic.
  - Present rider with their preference-match-summary for each prospective driver before they confirm a ride.
- Ride-Xtras (Driver Offers):
  - Standardized offering that driver's can choose to offer to riders after confirming a ride.
  - Some price variation allowed, but riders should feel they are getting a similar service for a similar price.
- Community Tab:
  - Community Highlights: User-created community highlights to share your local favorites with other people in your area.
    - These are highlights, not reviews - posts should speak postively and up-lift the place being posted about, and avoid giving a grade / score (It is assumed these places are A+).
    - These are not ads - posts should be made for prospective go-ers of your favorite local spots, telling users what made said spot your favorite (in 144 characters or less).
  - Feature Forum: Dev-created pages for features in active development, to discuss and provide feedback.

   
## 🤷 Future Goals 
- Delivery Options: Request food or package delivery from local restaurants or stores.
- Safety Features: SOS button, ride-sharing with trusted contacts, and driver verification.
- Ratings and Reviews: Receive feedback from riders to build reputation
- Driver Unions: Assist in forming regional driver unions that work to amplify driver feedback and voices.
