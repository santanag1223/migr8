# `migr8`: Community _driven_ ridesharing


## üìç Core Objectives

### Respect our drivers by **putting drivers in-charge of their own pricing model.**
- Drivers set their **rate ($/mile)**
  - 'Minimum-rates' should be set regionally to **ensure drivers are making a livable wage.**
    - Rate minimums should be subject to surge-pricing to match driver demand.
    - Present drivers with comparable ride rates to assist in setting their rate.
- Open new revenue streams for drivers by offering **additional comfort options for riders.**
  - Ride-Xtras (driver offers) such as stereo sharing, ad free music, baggage space, surplus-seating, additional-stops, truck bed, etc.
   
### Respect our riders by **not selling any data to third parties, or ride-time to advertisers.**
- Advertisments are impossible to avoid today.
- Thus, `migr8` can stand out by not selling any of our user's data or ride-time for an extra buck.

### Offer a better ride experience to drivers and riders alike by matching users along `Preferences`.
  - `Preference` Choices: Conversation, Music, Ride+Eat, Smoke+Vape, TalkMedia, etc.
  - A `Preference` is set to one of three values: (PreferNot | NoPreference | Prefer) along each topic
    - PreferNot: should **not** match with users who prefer topic.
    - NoPreference: the user is indifferent to topic.
    - Prefer: should match with users who prefer topic.
